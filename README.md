# MLP Regression Comparison with PyTorch and TensorFlow

This repository explores the implementation and comparison of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models using PyTorch and TensorFlow for regression analysis. 
The primary focus is on creating a neural network for regression tasks and examining the differences in implementation and performance between the two popular deep learning frameworks.
